This game called SnakeGame is developed with java. The snake moves on a map that I specified. Each time there is a collision between the head of the snake and the apple, the score is incremented. The goal is to have the best score. The game ends when there is a collision between the head and the body of the snake or between the head of the snake and the edges of the map. The graphical interface is implemented using the swing library and the package java.awt.
